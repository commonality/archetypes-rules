>
> A clear and transparent governance document is a key part of any open

## 1. Overview

The product development and delivery team and its community follow a
meritocratic, consensus-based governance model. Anyone with an interest in the
product can join the community, contribute to the product's design, and
participate in decision-making. This document describes how that participation
takes place and how participants earn merit within the our community.

## 2. Roles and responsibilities

### 2.1. Users

Users are community members who have a need for the project. They are the most
important members of the community and without them the project would have no
purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no special requirements.

The project asks its users to participate in the project and community as much
as possible. User contributions enable the project team to ensure that they are
satisfying the needs of those users. Common user contributions include (but are
not limited to):

-   Evangelising about the project (e.g. a link on a website and word-of-mouth
    awareness raising)
-   Informing developers of strengths and weaknesses from a new user perspective
-   Providing moral support (a ‘thank you’ goes a long way)

Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will often
become more and more involved. Such users may find themselves becoming
contributors, as described in the next section.

### 2.2. Contributors

Contributors are community members who contribute in concrete ways to the
project. Anyone can become a contributor, and contributions can take many forms,
as detailed in a separate document. There is no expectation of commitment to the
project, no specific skill requirements and no selection process.

In addition to their actions as users, contributors may also find themselves
doing one or more of the following:

-   Supporting new users (existing users are often the best people to support new
    users)
-   Reporting bugs
-   Identifying requirements
-   Providing graphics and web design
-   Programming
-   Assisting with project infrastructure
-   Writing documentation
-   Repairing defects
-   Adding features

Contributors engage with the project through the issue tracker and mailing list,
or by writing or editing documentation. They submit changes to the project
itself via patches, which will be considered for inclusion in the project by
existing committers (see next section). The developer mailing list is the most
appropriate place to ask for help when making that first contribution.

As contributors gain experience and familiarity with the project, their profile
within, and commitment to, the community will increase. At some stage, they may
find themselves being nominated for committership.

### 2.3. Maintainers

Maintainers are community members who have shown that they are committed to the
continued development of the project through ongoing engagement with the
community. Committership allows contributors to more easily carry on with their
product-related activities by giving them direct access to the product delivery
workflow's resources. That is, they can make changes directly to source code
outputs, without having to submit changes via patches.

This does not mean that a committer is free to do what they want. In fact,
committers have no more authority over the project than contributors. While
committership indicates a valued member of the community who has demonstrated a
healthy respect for the project’s aims and objectives, their work continues to
be reviewed by the community before acceptance in an official release. The key
difference between a committer and a contributor is when this approval is sought
from the community. A committer seeks approval after the contribution is made,
rather than before.

Seeking approval after making a contribution is known as a commit-then-review
process. It is more efficient to allow trusted people to make direct
contributions, as the majority of those contributions will be accepted by the
project. The project employs various communication mechanisms to ensure that all
contributions are reviewed by the community as a whole. By the time a
contributor is invited to become a committer, they will have become familiar
with the project’s various tools as a user and then as a contributor.

Anyone can become a committer; there are no special requirements, other than to
have shown a willingness and ability to participate in the project as a team
player. Typically, a potential committer will need to show that they have an
understanding of the project, its objectives and its strategy. They will also
have provided valuable contributions to the project over a period of time.

New committers can be nominated by any existing committer. Once they have been
nominated, there will be a vote by the project management committee (PMC; see
below). Committer voting is one of the few activities that takes place on the
project’s private management list. This is to allow PMC members to freely
express their opinions about a nominee without causing embarrassment. Once the
vote has been held, the aggregated voting results are published on the public
mailing list. The nominee is entitled to request an explanation of any ‘no’
votes against them, regardless of the outcome of the vote. This explanation will
be provided by the PMC Chair (see below) and will be anonymous and constructive
in nature.

Nominees may decline their appointment as a committer. However, this is unusual,
as the project does not expect any specific time or resource commitment from its
community members. The intention behind the role of committer is to allow people
to contribute to the project more easily, not to tie them in to the project in
any formal way.

It is important to recognise that commitership is a privilege, not a right. That
privilege must be earned and once earned it can be removed by the PMC (see next
section) in extreme circumstances. However, under normal circumstances
committership exists for as long as the committer wishes to continue engaging
with the project.

A committer who shows an above-average level of contribution to the project,
particularly with respect to its strategic direction and long-term health, may
be nominated to become a member of the PMC. This role is described below.

### 2.4. Product management committee (PMC)

The project management committee consists of those individuals identified as
"product owners" on the development site. The PMC has additional
responsibilities over and above those of a committer. These responsibilities
ensure the smooth running of the project. PMC members are expected to review
code contributions, participate in strategic planning, approve changes to the
governance model and manage the copyrights within the project outputs.

Members of the PMC do not have significant authority over other members of the
community, although it is the PMC that votes on new committers. It also makes
decisions when community consensus cannot be reached. In addition, the PMC has
access to the project’s private mailing list and its archives. This list is used
for sensitive issues, such as votes for new committers and legal matters that
cannot be discussed in public. It is never used for project management or
planning.

Membership of the PMC is by invitation from the existing PMC members. A
nomination will result in discussion and then a vote by the existing PMC
members. PMC membership votes are subject to consensus approval of the current
PMC members.

### 2.5. PMC Chair

The PMC Chair is a single individual, voted for by the PMC members. Once someone
has been appointed Chair, they remain in that role until they choose to retire,
or the PMC casts a two-thirds majority vote to remove them.

The PMC Chair has no additional authority over other members of the PMC: the
role is one of coordinator and facilitator. The Chair is also expected to ensure
that all governance processes are adhered to, and has the casting vote when the
project fails to reach consensus.

## 3. Support

All participants in the community are encouraged to provide support for new
users within the project management infrastructure. This support is provided as
a way of growing the community. Those seeking support should recognise that all
support activity within the project is voluntary and is therefore provided as
and when time allows. A user requiring guaranteed response times or results
should therefore seek to purchase a support contract from a community member.
However, for those willing to engage with the project on its own terms, and
willing to help support other users, the community support channels are ideal.

## 4. Contribution process

Anyone can contribute to the project, regardless of their skills, as there are
many ways to contribute. For instance, a contributor might be active on the
project mailing list and issue tracker, or might supply patches. The various
ways of contributing are described in more detail in a separate document.

The developer mailing list is the most appropriate place for a contributor to
ask for help when making their first contribution.

## 5. Decision-making processes

Decisions about the future of the project are made through discussion with all
members of the community, from the newest user to the most experienced PMC
member. All non-sensitive project management discussion takes place on the
project contributors’ mailing list. Occasionally, sensitive discussion occurs on
a private list.

In order to ensure that the project is not bogged down by endless discussion and
continual voting, the project operates a policy of lazy consensus. This allows
the majority of decisions to be made without resorting to a formal vote.

### 5.1. Lazy consensus

Decision making typically involves the following steps:

1.  Proposal

1.  Discussion

1.  Vote (if consensus is not reached through discussion)

1.  Decision

**Any community member can make a proposal for consideration by the community.**
In order to initiate a discussion about a new idea, they should send an email to
the project contributors’ list or submit a patch implementing the idea to the
issue tracker (or version-control system if they have commit access). This will
prompt a review and, if necessary, a discussion of the idea. The goal of this
review and discussion is to gain approval for the contribution. Since most
people in the project community have a shared vision, there is often little need
for discussion in order to reach consensus.

In general, as long as nobody explicitly opposes a proposal or patch, it is
recognised as having the support of the community. This is called lazy
consensus - that is, those who have not stated their opinion explicitly have
implicitly agreed to the implementation of the proposal.

Lazy consensus is a very important concept within the project. It is this
process that allows a large group of people to efficiently reach consensus, as
someone with no objections to a proposal need not spend time stating their
position, and others need not spend time reading such mails.

For lazy consensus to be effective, it is necessary to allow at least 72 hours
before assuming that there are no objections to the proposal. This requirement
ensures that everyone is given enough time to read, digest and respond to the
proposal. This time period is chosen so as to be as inclusive as possible of all
participants, regardless of their location and time commitments.

### 5.2. Architecturally significant decisions

Not all decisions can be made using lazy consensus. "Architecturally
significant" decisions, i.e., those that affect the structure, non-functional
characteristics, dependencies, interfaces, or construction techniques of a
project's development, delivery, and maintenance, should be documented with an
[Architecture Decision Record (ADR) ![link-external][octicon-link-external]](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
ADRs represent a well structured, relatively lightweight way to capture
architectural proposals. They can serve as an artifact for discussion, and
remain as an enduring record of the context and motivation of past decisions.

**Every ADR must gain the community's explicit approval in the form of a vote.**

### 5.3. Strategic direction and legal standing

Issues such as those affecting the strategic direction or legal standing of the
project must gain explicit approval in the form of a vote. Every member of the
community is encouraged to express their opinions in all discussion and all
votes. However, only project committers and/or PMC members (as defined above)
have binding votes for the purposes of decision making. A separate document on
the voting within a meritocratic governance model describes in more detail how
voting is conducted in projects following the practice established within the
Apache Software Foundation.
