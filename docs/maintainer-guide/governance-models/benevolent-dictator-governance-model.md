## 1. Overview

This project is led by a benevolent dictator and managed by the community. That
is, the community actively contributes to the day-to-day maintenance of the
project, but the general strategic line is drawn by the benevolent dictator. In
case of disagreement, they have the last word. It is the benevolent dictator’s
job to resolve disputes within the community and to ensure that the project is
able to progress in a coordinated way. In turn, it is the community’s job to
guide the decisions of the benevolent dictator through active engagement and
contribution.

## 2. Roles and responsibilities

### 2.1. Benevolent Dictator (product lead)

Typically, the benevolent dictator, or project lead, is self-appointed. However,
because the community always has the ability to fork, this person is fully
answerable to the community. The project lead’s role is a difficult one: they
set the strategic objectives of the project and communicate these clearly to the
community. They also have to understand the community as a whole and strive to
satisfy as many conflicting needs as possible, while ensuring that the project
survives in the long term.

In many ways, the role of the benevolent dictator is less about dictatorship and
more about diplomacy. The key is to ensure that, as the project expands, the
right people are given influence over it and the community rallies behind the
vision of the project lead. The lead’s job is then to ensure that the committers
(see below) make the right decisions on behalf of the project. Generally
speaking, as long as the committers are aligned with the project’s strategy, the
project lead will allow them to proceed as they desire.

### 2.2. Maintainers

Committers are contributors who have made several valuable contributions to the
project and are now relied upon to both write code directly to the repository
and screen the contributions of others. In many cases they are programmers but
it is also possible that they contribute in a different role. Typically, a
committer will focus on a specific aspect of the project, and will bring a level
of expertise and understanding that earns them the respect of the community and
the project lead. The role of committer is not an official one, it is simply a
position that influential members of the community will find themselves in as
the project lead looks to them for guidance and support.

Committers have no authority over the overall direction of the project. However,
they do have the ear of the project lead. It is a committer’s job to ensure that
the lead is aware of the community’s needs and collective objectives, and to
help develop or elicit appropriate contributions to the project. Often,
committers are given informal control over their specific areas of
responsibility, and are assigned rights to directly modify certain areas of the
source code. That is, although committers do not have explicit decision-making
authority, they will often find that their actions are synonymous with the
decisions made by the lead.

### 2.3. Contributors

**Contributors are community members who either have no desire to become
committers, or have not yet been given the opportunity by the benevolent
dictator.** They make valuable contributions, such as those outlined in the list
below, but generally do not have the authority to make direct changes to the
project code. Contributors engage with the project through communication tools,
such as email lists, and via reports and patches attached to issues in the issue
tracker, as detailed in our community tools document.

Anyone can become a contributor. There is no expectation of commitment to the
project, no specific skill requirements and no selection process. To become a
contributor, a community member simply has to perform one or more actions that
are beneficial to the project.

Some contributors will already be engaging with the project as users, but will
also find themselves doing one or more of the following:

- Adding features
- Assisting with project infrastructure
- Identifying requirements
- Programming
- Repairing defects
- Reporting defects
- Supplying graphics and web design
- Supporting new users (current users often provide the most effective new user
  support)
- Writing documentation

As contributors gain experience and familiarity with the project, they may find
that the project lead starts relying on them more and more. When this begins to
happen, they gradually adopt the role of committer, as described above.

### 2.4. Users

Users are community members who have a need for the project. They are the most
important members of the community: without them, the project would have no
purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no specific requirements.

Users should be encouraged to participate in the life of the project and the
community as much as possible. User contributions enable the project team to
ensure that they are satisfying the needs of those users. Common user activities
include (but are not limited to):

- Evangelising about the project
- Informing developers of project strengths and weaknesses from a new user’s
  perspective
- Providing moral support (a ‘thank you’ goes a long way)
- Providing financial support

Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will often find
themselves becoming more and more involved. Such users may then go on to become
contributors, as described above.

## 3. Support

All participants in the community are encouraged to provide support for new
users within the project management infrastructure. This support is provided as
a way of growing the community. Those seeking support should recognise that all
support activity within the project is voluntary and is therefore provided as
and when time allows. A user requiring guaranteed response times or results
should therefore seek to purchase a support contract from a vendor. (Of course,
that vendor should be an active member of the community.) However, for those
willing to engage with the project on its own terms, and willing to help support
other users, the community support channels are ideal.

## 4. Contribution process

Anyone can contribute to the project, regardless of their skills, as there are
many ways to contribute. For instance, a contributor might be active on the
project mailing list and issue tracker, or might supply patches. The various
ways of contributing are described in more detail in our roles in open source
document.

The developer mailing list is the most appropriate place for a contributor to
ask for help when making their first contribution.

## 5. Decision-making processes

The benevolent dictatorship model does not need a formal conflict resolution
process, since the project lead’s word is final. If the community chooses to
question the wisdom of the actions of a committer, the project lead can review
their decisions by checking the email archives, and either uphold or reverse
them.
